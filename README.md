# Metaphorical Connections

Included in `metaphorical-connections.csv` are 186 poems collected on Amazon Mechanical Turk in March and April 2018. Each worker was given a metaphorical prompt and asked to write a four-line poem on the theme the prompt presents, as well as to use poetic stylistic elements such as rhyme, alliteration, and line breaks. Originally 200 poems were collected, but 14 were removed for plagiarism. Not all poems are exactly four lines long. Despite this, we kept and analyzed all poems that were not plagiarized.

The 10 metaphorical prompts used were:

* Anger is wood
* Compassion is blood
* Death is a rose
* God is a breath
* Grace is a garden
* Hate is a mist
* Hope is a ship
* Immortality is a room
* Peace is a rock
* Surrender is a book

Two evaluators looked at all poems and marked the category they believed the poem belonged in. Because evalutors could disagree, some poems are marked as being in two categories. For a given poem, if only one category is marked this means the evaluators agreed.
